# Note that this configuration differs slightly from what is in chapter 14.
# Whereas the GitHub org/user was "tacocloud" in the book, that name doesn't
# actually exist in GitHub. Instead, the configuration shown here references
# my GitHub org/user where there is an actual "tacocloud-config" repository.
# You are welcome to continue using this repository as a source of configuration
# data, but if you want to play around and tweak the configuration, you'll
# need to setup your own configuration repository (or fork mine).
